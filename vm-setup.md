# 🏗️ Setting Up Virtual Machines
<p>To analyse traffic I setup two virtual machines in Azure. The first was a Windows 10 machine and the second an Ubuntu Server machine. I set these up on the same virtual network so that they could communicate to each other. I then tested this communication using the <code>ping</code> command to send a ICMP packet from the Windows 10 machine to the Ubuntu Server.</p>

## Video Demonstration

- ### [YouTube: How To Setup Virtual Machines in Azure](https://www.youtube.com)

## Environments and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Microsoft Azure Subscription
- Reliable Internet Connection

<h2>Setup Steps</h2>


<p>
Navigate to portal.azure.com. Either make an account or login. At the home page use the search bar to find "Resource groups". This will be the container to hold the virtual machines that will be used in this project.

<p>
Once in "Resource groups", select "+Create".

</p>
<br />


<p>
Then assign a name in the "Resource group" dialogue box and select the appropriate region for your resources to be hosted. Then click "Review + create".

</p>
<br />


<p>
Make sure you've named it appropriately so you know what the resource group is for and then click "Create"
</p>

<p>
Your screen should look like this. Now to create the Virtual Machines.

<p>
Next, search for "Virtual Machines" in the search bar and select it.

</p>
<br />

<p>
Click "Create", then "Azure virtual machine".

</p>
<br />

<p>
Then select the resource group you created. Give your VM a name and make sure the VM is in the same region as the resource group. Then, under "Image", select "Windows 10 Pro, version 21H2 - x64 Gen2". This will be the VM that most of our work will be done from.

<p>
Next, select the drop down menu next to "Size" to change to a more capable machine. Assigning 2-4 vcpus and 16GB memory to the VM.

<br />

<p>
Scroll down the page and create an administrator account. Make sure to record your username and password. Usually it's not good practice to write down a password but in this case we will be deleting this machine as soon as we're done. You'll also want to make sure the you tick the "Licensing" box, otherwise you wont be able to create the VM.

</p>
<br />

<p>
Next, at the top of the screen, click on "Networking". Here we will make sure that network settings are configured correctly. We want Azure to create a Virtual Network. Take note of the name as we will use it when we make the next VM. Also, allow it to assign a subnet. Here it is set to 10.0.0.0/24.

<p>
Finally, go to the top again and select "Review + create" and then "Create" at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Azure will then begin deploying the VM. It will take a couple of minutes as it assigns the appropriate resources.

<p>
Navigate back to the Virtual Machines page and you will be able to see the VM there.

You have successfully setup and deployed a virtual machines in Azure. The [next section]() takes ypu through how to setup a VPN using ProtonVPN and then see how VPN Tunneling works.
