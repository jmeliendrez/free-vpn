# Set Up a Free VPN (ProtonVPN)

Recently I set up a VPN in an Azure Virtual Machine to be able to test out how different public IP addresses worked. I also wanted to try out ProtonVPN's free tier. I used a Windows 10 image and installed ProtonVPN software onto it. I then enabled the VPN to tunnel my network traffic through one of their servers. IT was pretty simple. Below are the docs for what I did to set up and run the VPN.
